## Keno simulator

There are 4 common strategies in Keno.

* Picking the same sequence of numbers at each play
* Randomly picking numbers
* Picking numbers that are slightly infrequent.
* Pyramid pick. [Ref.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbNzWLCJbto)

This script explores each of these and try to determine if one of them is any better than other.

My findings suggest that none of these strategies have any significant impact on winnings. However, picking 5 numbers and playing the Keno bonus increases the probability of profit in the long run (100+ games).
